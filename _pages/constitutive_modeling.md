## Anisotropic MCC model:
I have developed a constitutive model to capture the anisotropic mechanical response of transversely isotropic rocks like shale and implemented the model in a finite element framework for boundary-value problem simulations[1]. With the proposed model, I reproduced the U-shaped variation curve between rock strength and bedding plane orientations for shale observed in laboratory experiments. In addition, this model also allows for consideration of the thermal effect through the incorporation of thermal softening in the hardening law. Through finite element simulations, we found that the failure modes in shale in the form of shear bands are determined by both the constitutive model and the boundary conditions, and the two factors can lead to complex zigzagged failure patterns in shale. 

## Cam-Clay IX model:
As a contributing author, I contributed to the development of the Cam-Clay IX model that considers anisotropy, material heterogeneity, and viscoplasticity of shale[2]. This model can properly quantify the mechanical response of shale with different material compositions. Besides, it can capture time-dependent processes such as creep and relaxation in shale. Moreover, for the first time reported in the literature, we showed that a shear band can form in a shale specimen even with a constant load when the viscosity in its mechanical response is considered, a phenomenon we called “creep-induced strain localization”.

## Double-yield-surface plasticity model:
we together analyzed the individual impact of weak bedding planes, in addition to an anisotropic rock matrix, on the mechanical responses of shale[3], and proposed a double-yield-surface plasticity model.
