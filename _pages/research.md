# Summary of Ph.D. Research at Stanford University  

My Ph.D. research primarily focused on investigating the hydromechanical response of shale, a sedimentary rock commonly encountered in the exploration of subsurface energy. For instance, shale is the gas-bearing material in shale gas exploitation, and it often serves as a seal rock for CO2 sequestration. Shale is an anisotropic rock with a laminated bedding structure, and it’s a heterogenous material made up of hard materials such as quartz and carbonate, and soft materials including kerogen. In addition, shale is a tight rock where the voids exist as either micro fractures or nanopores, resulting in a bimodal pore size distribution. My Ph.D. research is to develop novel mathematical and computational models to quantify the coupled solid deformation and fluid flow in shale reflecting these unique factors in shale, and my major contributions include the following:  

<b>(I)</b> I have developed a constitutive model to capture the anisotropic mechanical response of transversely isotropic rocks like shale and implemented the model in a finite element framework for boundary-value problem simulations[1]. With the proposed model, I reproduced the U-shaped variation curve between rock strength and bedding plane orientations for shale observed in laboratory experiments. In addition, this model also allows for consideration of the thermal effect through the incorporation of thermal softening in the hardening law. Through finite element simulations, we found that the failure modes in shale in the form of shear bands are determined by both the constitutive model and the boundary conditions, and the two factors can lead to complex zigzagged failure patterns in shale. As a contributing author, I contributed to the development of the Cam-Clay IX model that considers anisotropy, material heterogeneity, and viscoplasticity of shale[2]. This model can properly quantify the mechanical response of shale with different material compositions. Besides, it can capture time-dependent processes such as creep and relaxation in shale. Moreover, for the first time reported in the literature, we showed that a shear band can form in a shale specimen even with a constant load when the viscosity in its mechanical response is considered, a phenomenon we called “creep-induced strain localization”.  

<b>(II)</b> I have developed a novel continuum poromechanical framework for coupled solid deformation and fluid flow through anisotropic elastoplastic porous media[3]. The effective stress concept and the poromechanical framework pioneered by Terzaghi and Biot have been widely adopted to illustrate coupled fluid flow and solid deformation in porous rocks, but there were still some links missing for anisotropic and ductile rocks like shale. Based on the mixture theory and continuum thermodynamics, I derived a novel mathematical framework for coupled solid deformation and fluid flow through anisotropic elastoplastic porous media, which involves a new set of governing equations for mass conservation of fluid and solid, and a new effective stress formulation that identifies distinct forms of effective stress for elastic response and plastic response respectively. Coefficients that emerge in the governing equations are evaluated naturally through the derivation, thus the proposed framework won’t require any additional constitutive law or assumption for parameter evaluation. For this work, I also developed a mixed finite element framework for its numerical implementation and conducted simulations of a consolidation problem with strip loading to reveal the unique hydromechanical response in anisotropic elastoplastic porous rocks.  

<b>(III)</b> I have developed a novel continuum poromechanical framework for shale considering the bimodal pore size distribution from the existing form of voids in shale as either microcracks or nanopores. Specifically speaking, I extended the framework discussed in (II) with the double porosity theory, which allows for the consideration of different permeability and constitutive law for fluid flow at different pore scales[4]. This work is the first of its kind to integrate factors including anisotropy, elastoplasticity, and double porosity in the analysis of hydromechanical responses of shale. With this proposed framework, I reproduced the 1-D consolidation process of Opalinus shale, and both the primary and the secondary consolidation processes were captured, which correspond to the dissipation of pore pressure in microcracks and in nanopores respectively.  

Overall speaking, my Ph.D. work provides novel mathematical and computational models for coupled solid deformation and fluid flow in shale, considering its unique hydromechanical responses resulting from material anisotropy, material heterogeneity, ductility, and the existing form of void space in shale. My collaboration with Professor Borja continues after my graduation, and we together analyzed the individual impact of weak bedding planes, in addition to an anisotropic rock matrix, on the mechanical responses of shale[5]. Moreover, I also served as a contributing author and provided guidance for a graduate student to investigate how chemical-reaction-induced solid dissolution would influence the hydromechanical responses of shale and undermine the seal integrity of CO2 sequestration reservoirs.  
    
# Current Works at Tsinghua University

My postdoctoral research at Tsinghua University aims to understand how brittle fracture occurs in shale. In shale gas exploitation, hydraulic fracturing is the most common method to crack shale and produce gas. In CO2 sequestration, the injection of CO2 will alter the stress field in the reservoir, and it is critical to understand how shale cracks under such circumstances to evaluate the integrity of the seal rocks and the risk of gas leakage. In this process, I have developed a new tensile failure criterion for transversely isotropic rocks like shale[6], in which I extended the Rankine criterion with the alternative stress concept, and treated failure along weak bedding planes with distinction. Eventually, the proposed model achieved better performance than any other criterion reported in the literature. Now I am working on incorporating this failure criterion into fracture models for boundary-value problem simulations, in the hope of revealing the fracturing processes of shale given different hydraulic and mechanical loadings. In the future, this work can be integrated with my Ph.D. research, they together can depict a full loading cycle on shale from elastic deformation, to inelastic deformation, and to fracture, for practical engineering problems involving complex hydraulic, chemical, and mechanical loadings.
