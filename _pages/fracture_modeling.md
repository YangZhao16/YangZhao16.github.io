## A dual-mechanism tensile failure criterion for transversely isotropic rocks 
<p align="justify">
Tensile failure is a common failue mode in shale in engineering applications such as shale gas exploitation. Tensile for transversely isotropic rocks like shale is usually dependent on the bedding plane orientation in the material, and the Nova-Zaninetti criterion is commonly accepted as the tensile failure criterion with the best performance, which extends the Rankine criterion by constructing a bedding-orientation-dependent rock strength with a rank-two tensor to characterize the anisotropy in rock strength. Such a criterion can be fully calibrated with rock tensile strength along the bed-normal and bed-parallel directions, and the shape of the variation curve of rock tensile strength with bedding plane orientation is determined by the anisotropy ratio, defined as the ratio between rock strength along the bed-parallel direction and the bed-normal direction.

The figure above illustrates the variation of tensile strength with bedding plane orientation for several kinds of transversely isotropic rocks with an anisotropy ratio near 4, and the prediction generated with the Nova-Zaninetti criterion. From the figure we can conclude that the Nova-Zaninetti criterion has the following shortcomes:  
</p>  

* The shape of variation curve of rock tensile strength predicted with the Nova-Zaninetti criterion is determined with a given anisotropy ratio, but in reality there can be different forms of the variation curves;  
* For rocks with weakly-cemented bedding planes such as the Midgley Grit Sandstone, there exists a transition in the strength variation curve distinguishing failure along bedding planes or through rock matrix, which can not be reproduced by the Nova-Zaninetti criterion;
* It has been revealed in literatures that the prediction of failure plane orientation with the Nova-Zaninetti can hardly be regarded as perfect.
