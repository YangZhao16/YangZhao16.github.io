 I acquired my Ph.D. degree in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Stanford University in September 2021, under the supervision of Professor Ronaldo I. Borja. Due to the Covid pandemic and some family factors, I went back to China after graduation and took a transitional position working as a postdoctoral scholar at the Department of Hydraulic Engineering at Tsinghua University, working with Professor Jian-min Zhang.
